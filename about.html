                What is Tetris®?
            </h1>
            <p>Tetris is a classic puzzle video game where players arrange falling blocks, known as "Tetriminos," to
                create
                complete horizontal lines. As the blocks descend, players must rotate and fit them together in
                real-time,
                with completed lines disappearing and earning points. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the
                top
                of the screen. Created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, Tetris is renowned for its simple yet addictive
                gameplay
                and has become a cultural icon, available on a wide range of platforms and influencing numerous other
                games.

                How do you play?
            </h1>
            <p>To play Tetris, the goal is to arrange falling blocks, called "Tetriminos," to form complete horizontal
                lines. As the Tetriminos fall from the top of the screen, you can move them left or right, rotate them,
                and
                drop them quickly to the bottom. When a line is completed, it disappears, and you earn points. The game
                continues, with the speed of falling blocks increasing as you progress. If the blocks stack up to the
                top of
                the screen without clearing lines, the game ends. The challenge lies in strategically placing and
                rotating
                the Tetriminos to clear as many lines as possible before the screen fills up.

                Who Created Tetris®?
            </h1>
            <p>In 1984, Tetris® was born from the imagination of computer programmer Alexey Pajitnov. Inspired by his
                favorite puzzle board game, Pentominos, Pajitnov created an electronic game that let players arrange
                puzzle
                pieces in real time as they fell from the top of the playing field. The resulting design was a game that
                used seven distinctive geometric playing pieces, each made up of four squares. Pajitnov called this game
                “Tetris,” a combination of “tetra” (the Greek word meaning “four”) and “tennis” (his favorite sport).

            <h1>
                The Tetris® Effect
            </h1>
            <p>The Tetris® Effect is a catchy term that players use to describe the way they are inspired by the game
                and
                see Tetriminos in everyday situations. Because Tetris, like the real world, challenges players to make
                order
                out of chaos using a specific organization system, the game components translate easily into lifestyle
                interpretations. Whether you're packing the trunk of your car, loading a dishwasher, or organizing your
                shelves, you're likely thinking about how each object will fit together strategically with minimal empty
                space. This is the Tetris Effect!
